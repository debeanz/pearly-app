-- What it sets up, and who can do what with the PUBLIC (anon) key that ships
-- inside the app and the website:
--   reports       anyone can file one and read them all; nobody can edit or
--                 delete one through the API (you can, in the dashboard)
--   game_summary  per-game totals the Compatibility page lists
--   logs bucket   anyone can UPLOAD a report's log; only you can READ one
--                 (Storage in the dashboard) — logs carry device paths, so they
--                 are never public
-- Re-running the script is safe.
